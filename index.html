							<h2>Who I am</h2>
							<p>I'm a young digital professional with a technological and aesthetic background in structured content, data, and digital marketing. I am passionate about storytelling as a way to communicate, learn, and connect with others. I began my academic career in <strong>Information Technology</strong> because I am fascinated by technology and new trends. At the time, I started designing websites for my professor and then creating educational content for their website. Writing has always been a passion, and I wrote short stories about wild animals' lives when I was a kid.
After a while, I became aware of a deficit in my economic and management knowledge and decided to further my education in business management. While working as a <strong>webmaster</strong>, <strong>SEO consultant</strong>, and <strong>content creator</strong>, <strong>social media manager</strong>, I completed my bachelor's degree in <strong>Business Management</strong>. 
During my education, I have worked with different companies and marketing agencies that faced new challenges and circumstances, and I learned how to manage various projects with other objectives. 
Bypassing time, my passion for writing articles and designing catchy content for websites increased, and I got familiar with the concept of SEO. Then I read a lot about SEO because if I wanted to continue my career as a content writer, I had to know about SEO tools and its principle. 
Honestly, it was my dream job and a mixture of data and research besides writing skills.</p>

							<h2>What I do</h2>
							<p> Throughout my studies, I worked at <strong>Digital360</strong>, <strong>L'Oréal</strong>, <strong>Netflix</strong>, <strong>Too Good To Go</strong>, <strong>Hamilton Hotel</strong>, and <strong>Haier</strong> on keyword research, competitor website traffic analysis, market research, and online marketing.
My academic path began with <strong>Information Technology</strong>, then <strong>Business Management</strong>, and completed with <strong>Management Engineering (Digital Business & Market Innovation)</strong> from Politecnico di Milano.
I have over five years of experience developing and implementing data-driven content strategies for websites and social media.

I am an active learner and a good listener. Rather than simply accepting ideas and assumptions, I examine them. I can prioritize projects based on their importance and effort. Some priorities include keyword research, content quality, backlinks, and mobile optimization. I like dealing with data, both collecting and analyzing it.
